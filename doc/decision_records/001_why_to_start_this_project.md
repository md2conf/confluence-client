## Context and Problem Statement

### Docs-as-code meets Confluence

1. Confluence, a popular CMS system, doesn't have official tool to publish
markdown content to a Confluence instance.
2. A lot of projects and teams want to use docs-as-code approach and use Confluence as CMS system.

To solve this gap a lot of 3-party tools exists.

For java developers are most popular are

* [confluence-publisher](https://github.com/confluence-publisher/confluence-publisher) - Maven plugin and Docker image to convert AsciiDoc and publish it to Confluence
* [bsorrentino/maven-confluence-plugin](https://github.com/bsorrentino/maven-confluence-plugin) - Maven plugin that generates project's documentation directly to confluence allowing to keep in-sync project evolution with its documentation
* [qwazer/markdown-confluence-gradle-plugin](https://github.com/qwazer/markdown-confluence-gradle-plugin) - Gradle plugin to publish markdown pages to confluence
